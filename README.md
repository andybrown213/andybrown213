# <h1 align='center'>âœ¨ Hello and Welcome to my GitHub âœ¨</h1>

## Long time coder, short time GitHub user 

Been dabbling since simple html pages in middle school and C++ in high school (20 some years ago ðŸ˜¬). Figure it might finally be time to take it seriously!

So, that said, I guess I can start sharing my projects in repositories and get with the times..

## Technology Specific Interests

My main focus at this time is web development. I figure this is where any cool tools I build can be most accessible to the general public and well, the internet is cool.

I also decided (though it has been kind of an adventure, to say the least..), to switch from Windows to Arch Linux. I am no doubt still a newbie, but I have learned a ton and am able to avoid Windows 95% of the time. ðŸ¥³

Since hacking is a thing, I've developed a keen interest lately in cryptography and its implementation in web security. This has sparked a renewed interest in math.. which is fun. Sometimes. ðŸ‘€

As a caveat, I have interest in pretty much anything script related. I'm not scared of a rabbit hole, love to learn, and must have at least 30 tabs open at once!
